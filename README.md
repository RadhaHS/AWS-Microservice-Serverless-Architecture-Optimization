# Microservice-Serverless-Architecture-Optimization
This project sets up a serverless RESTful API through Amazon API Gateway, which connects to an AWS Lambda function to execute CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a DynamoDB table. The architecture demonstrates a Serverless Microservice design aimed at achieving high scalability, cost efficiency, and minimal maintenance effort.
